# string

String is A series(连续) of characters(字符).

All quotation marks are strings. The quotation marks can be single or double quotation marks.

## use method to modify the case of a string

```python
name = "james bond"

# title(): Change the first letter(信，字母) of each word to uppercase.
print(name.title())       # output: James Bond

# change the string to all uppercase or all lowercase:
print(name.upper())    # output: JAMES BOND
print(name.lower())    # output: james bond
```

The method of lower() is very useful.

You cannot rely on the user to provide the correct case, so you need to convert the strings to lower case before storing then.
When you need to display this messages in the future, convert it to the most appropriate(合适，适当) case.

## combine(concatenated) string

```python
first_name = "james"
last_name = "bond"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name.title())
```

## use tabs or newlines to add whitespace

```python
>>> print("language:\n\tpython\n\tjava\n\tcpp")
language:
        python
        java
        cpp
```

## delete blank (or specified characters)

To the programmer, `'python'` and `'python '` look almost the same, but to the program, but to the program, they are two different strings.

you can use the [strip() (脱掉，卸)] method to delete the specified characters at the beginging or end of the string.

if not specified, it will remove spaces by default.

```python
>>> '   python  '.strip()           # strip(): remove the spaces on both sides of the string.
'python'
>>> '   python  '.lstrip()          # lstrip(): remove the spaces on the left side of the string
'python  '
>>> '   python  '.rstrip()          # rstrip(): remove the spaces on the right side of the string
'   python'

>>> 'python'.strip('n')             # remove the 'n' on both sides
'pytho'
>>> 'python'.lstrip('py')           # remove the 'py' on the left
'thon'
```
