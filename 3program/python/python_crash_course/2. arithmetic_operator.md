# Quick start: Basics

## Arithmetic operator

`+ - * / // % **`

- `//` modulo division
  the quotient is always rounded downwards(floor quotient towards negative infinity), even if it is already negative.

  ```python
  a / n = q with remainder r
  a // n = q (quotient)

  10 // 3 = 3
  10 // -3 = -4   # 10 / -3 = -3.333... (quotient towards negative infinity), so modulo is -4
  -10 // 3 = -4
  -10 // -3 = 3
  ```

- `%` remainder operator

  ```python
  # use the example above
  a / n = q with remainder r
  |r| < |n|

  # There may be two remainder: negative and positive. In mathematical number theory, mathematicians always prefer the positive--quotient towards negative infinity.

  # For python:
  a % n = r = a - n * (a // b)

  # so, in the calculation of negative numbers:
  10 // -3 = -4
  10 % -3 = 10 - (-3) * (-4) = -2
  ```

- `**` the power operator
  Note that the power operator has a higher priority than negation(monocular subtraction), so `-3**` is equivalent to `-(3**2)`.
  If you want to calculate `(-3)**2`, it must be specified.

  ```python
  # in fact, we can use the function pow() instead of the power operator.
  >>> 3 ** 2
  9
  >>> pow(3, 2)

  >>> pow(10, -2)
  0.01
  ```

## Positional Notation (进位制)

hexadecimal, octal, binary are represented(代表，表示) in the following ways:

```python
>>> 0xAF
175
>>> 0o10
8
>>> 0b10100101
165
```

## functions

### built-in functions

python provides many functions that can be used to accomplish many magical tasks.

- pow(): the power operator

- abs(): calculate absolute value

- round(): round float number to the nearest integer

### module

can thing of modules as extensions, and . can extend python functions by import them.

module math:

the difference between round(), math.floor(), math.ceil(), int():

```python
>>> int(5.1),int(5.9)         # integer
(5, 5)
>>> round(5.1), round(5.9)    # round float to the nearest integer
(5, 6)
>>> math.floor(5.1), math.floor(5.9)
(5, 5)
>>> math.ceil(5.1), math.ceil(5.9)
(6, 6)
>>>
```
