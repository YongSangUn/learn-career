```python
name = "james bond"

# title(): Change the first letter(信，字母) of each word to uppercase.
print(name.title())       # output: James Bond

# change the string to all uppercase or all lowercase:
print(name.upper())    # output: JAMES BOND
print(name.lower())    # output: james bond
```

The method of lower() is very useful.

first_name = "james"
last_name = "bond"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name.title())
```
